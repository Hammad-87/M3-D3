        PICTURE ALBUM EXERCISE - PAIR PROGRAMMING
​
        As it is a pair programming exercise, you must create a shared repository in which the first developer will be implementing odd exercises, other developer will implement even. For each exercise you must create a dedicated git branch. When you complete an exercise in pair programming, you must merge that branch into master, then the other developer will fetch & pull and only then he can solve his exercise with same modalities, and you will continue in this way.
​
        Starting from the current "base" bootstrap layout, implement the following exercises:
​
        1) When pressing on Load Images button, load the pictures from http://www.splashbase.co/api/v1/images/search?query=your query
        2) When pressing on Load Seconday Images, load the pictures from http://www.splashbase.co/api/v1/images/search?query=your secondary query
        3) When the user clicks on the "VIEW" button inside the Card, the image must be shown in a Modal View
        4) The Edit button should be replace with a "Hide" button. 
        5) When the hide button is pressed, the whole picture card disappears.
        6) Replace the "9 mins" template with the ID of the Image
        
        [EXTRA]
        7) Add in the "jumbotron" a search field. If there is a value there and the user press "Load Seconday Image" the API call should use the specified query as query
        8) After every button is pressed, display in an alert for 5 seconds the result of the operation (es.: 20 images loaded)
        9) Handle API error gracefully using alert buttons with the message inside
        10) Add at the bottom of the page a carousel with the images loaded by another API call
​
        [HINT]
        Use Template Literals to create the items in the list.
        Use arrow functions to make some practice with them
